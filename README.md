```

3. Build and preview

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

GitHub

- Initialize a remote repository on GitHub and push your local repo to it. Example:

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial scaffold"
# create a GitHub repo (from the web or gh cli) and then:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/chatbot-website-coding-challenge.git
git push -u origin main

Guidelines for the challenge
- No backend required — everything can run in local state
- Keep UI responsive and accessible
- Keep code small and easy to review
